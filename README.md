# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A fun and interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game built with JavaScript. Players can choose one of three options—rock, paper, or scissors—and compete against the computer. The game logic determines the winner based on the classic rules and provides real-time feedback to the player. This project demonstrates the use of JavaScript for handling user input, random choices, and displaying results dynamically.
